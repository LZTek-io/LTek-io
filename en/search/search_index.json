We selected Quickbase as our platform of choice because of it's fast iteration time. We can build, update, and improve the software very quickly by using Quickbase's platform as our backend. In this guide we will review how to navigate within Sightline. Because the platform is built on Quickbase's platform there are some very straight forward built-in navigational tools which we will review. Sightline uses \"Apps\" that allow you to separate core features and functions from one another. The Sightline App Suite consists of 22 unique and different apps. Each time our team encounters a new industry a new app may be made and integrated into the software platform for that industry. Any app we develop in Sightline will be available to other users and we will keep the community up to date as best we can in our Discord Community . List of the apps in our current app suite: HQ Permissions Client Permissions Vendor Permissions HR Manager CRM VRM Time Tracker Billing File Vault Training Elements Pricing Logistics Equipment Materials Lab Production Purchase Orders ERP User Feedback Cut & Sew * IT & Backend * Propertii * * Industry Specific Apps (List updated on 2022/12/02) Please reference the nav bar on the left to jump between the different basic guides.

Apps You can navigate between apps by going to the \"My Apps\" tab. Each time you open an app it will open a new App Tab and store it in the App Bar for easy access later. You can categorize your apps if you'd like and filter based on the category. You can quickly swap between recently used apps by clicking on the tabs in the App Bar. 2. Dashboards Each app has a Dashboard/Home Page. Dashboards can be different depending on their purpose and guides for navigating the dashboard(s) within each app can be found in the \"Plans\" section. You can navigate to the Dashboard/Home Page by clicking on the \"Home\" button on the left side of the navigation bar. 3. Tables Tables are similar to a single tab in an excel spreadsheet. You can navigate to the different tables by selecting each table from the Navigation Bar. Each table displays a default report when you arrive. You can also click the drop-down on the right-hand side and search for a specific table. 4. Reports Each Table may have more than one report. Reports are unique ways to browse the information in each table. Reports may filters tables in different ways or leave out different fields. Some have specific uses, or are designed for exporting. If you ever need a new report made reach out to us on our Discord Community ! Once you have navigated to the report you want there are different ways to edit/interact with the data on the report. Reports allow you to Grid edit the information, filter the information, downloadload a CSV of the report, save a link to the report and more. 5. Forms/Records You can create, view, and modify a record from the report/table view. Create a record using the \"+ New ____\" button. To view a single record you can click the eye next to it on the left. To edit, the pencil. That's all there is to it!
