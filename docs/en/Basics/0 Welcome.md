# 0 Sightline Basics
### Sightline is built using Quickbase's low-code platform.
We selected Quickbase as our platform of choice because of it's fast iteration time. We can build, update, and improve the software very quickly by using Quickbase's platform as our backend.

In this guide we will review how to navigate within Sightline. Because the platform is built on Quickbase's platform there are some very straight forward built-in navigational tools which we will review.

Sightline uses "Apps" that allow you to separate core features and functions from one another. The Sightline App Suite consists of 22 unique and different apps. Each time our team encounters a new industry a new app may be made and integrated into the software platform for that industry. Any app we develop in Sightline will be available to other users and we will keep the community up to date as best we can in our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/zNCZnKNXEv).
