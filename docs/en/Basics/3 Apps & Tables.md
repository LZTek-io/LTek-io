# Apps & Tables
In Sightline we use Apps and the Tables within the apps to create the structure of the software.

## Apps
Each app in the Sightline suite connects to the other apps. Each app focuses on a specific purpose and function allowing you to focus on your work and stay productive. Each app is made of multiple tables and the tables hold your data. Each table in the navigation bar is unique to the app that you are using.

A single app may have 20 or 30 tables. Don't forget about the drop-down arrown on the right hand side to quickly find and search for a specific table in each app.

## Tables
Each row on a report/table represents a single record. When you create a new record you will be redirected to a form that will prompt you to fill out the required information for that record. Clicking the üëÅÔ∏è on a single record will allow you to view all the data about that one record from a form view. Each form represents a single record on the table and because each table stores different information each form is also different.

Using grid edit üìù on a table can be handy, but remember that the forms will always have the best formatting to edit the data and interact with the data on the record.
